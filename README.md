Upgrade
-------
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/tomslominski/infinity-squared/releases/latest) from GitHub and enter the folder which houses `index.php`.
2. Remember to do a backup before you make any changes on your server.
3. Replace all of the files from the downloaded release with the release on your server. **Remember that if you've made any changes to the core theme files, they will be overwritten, so be careful!** A `config.php` is not provided with the release, so you don't need to worry about loosing your settings.
4. Copy over any new settings from `config-sample.php` into your own `config.php`.

Customisation
-------------
You can customise Infinity Squared by editing the `public/config.php` file. The file explains what each of the settings does and how to modify them.

You can also create a `public/custom.css` style and change the appropriate setting in `config.php` to enable you to add your own CSS which will not be overwritten on upgrade.

Translating
-----------
By default, Infinity Squared comes with Polish, Russian and Spanish translations, as well as it's default English language. To enable any of those languages, you need to edit YOURLS' `config.php`, as described [here](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/wiki/YOURLS-in-your-language#install-yourls-in-your-language).

If you want to translate Infinity Squared into your own language, [this blog post](http://blog.yourls.org/2013/02/workshop-how-to-create-your-own-translation-file-for-yourls/) from YOURLS describes how to do it. You can find the latest .pot file in `public/languages/isq_translation-source.pot`. Please follow the contributing guidelines below to add your translation to Infinity Squared.
